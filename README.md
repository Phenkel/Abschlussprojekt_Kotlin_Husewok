# Husewok - ReadMe

## Description
Husewok is a Kotlin app project developed for the final examination in the Android module of my Mobile App Developer training at the Syntax Institute. The app is designed as a Housework Randomizer with gamification elements. After completing a housework task, the user is required to play a game. Losing the game results in receiving a disliked housework task, while winning rewards the user with a preferred task. The app allows users to edit, add, and delete housework tasks. 

## Features
- Housework Randomizer: The app provides a random selection of housework tasks for the user to complete.
- Gamification: After completing a housework task, the user is prompted to play a game. Winning the game rewards the user with a preferred task, while losing results in receiving a disliked task.
- Task Management: Users can edit, add, and delete housework tasks according to their preferences.
- Firebase Integration: The app utilizes Firebase as the backend for data storage and management.

## Future Plans
For future updates of the app, I plan to implement the following features:
- Friend System: Users will be able to connect with friends and share their housework progress.
- Image Editing: Users will have the ability to edit and customize images associated with their housework tasks.
